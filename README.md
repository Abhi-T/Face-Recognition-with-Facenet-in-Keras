# Face-Recognition-with-Facenet-in-Keras
FaceNet as its deep learning based face recognition model. Facenet uses Inception model.

This is a Face recognition project built using facenet model.I have used the pretrained model and then used euclidean distance to find recognize the face.

Face detection is done using haar classifier with open CV. 

This model can be used directly without any modification. Please place the required input files in database folder and then the model using webcam.
